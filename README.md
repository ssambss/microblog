# Microblog

A little microblog project in which the user can add a new entry to the page, the entry is saved to MongoDB so it can be read later as well. I used Flask for the backend and HTML and CSS to create the frontend. Other things I learned during this project were Jinja2 templating, basic use of MongoDB, better folder structure, deploying an application through Heroku and Figma for designing the site. Obvious additions to this application would be user authentication and making it so every user only sees their own entries.
